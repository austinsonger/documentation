OwlH Node
=========

What is OwlH Node?
------------------

This is a single box running your NIDS systems, like Suricata and Zeek.
While you do your local analysis with your Suricata and Zeek, you can also do things like:

* Forward sniffed traffic in real time to a different system 
* Collect traffic from remote servers sent by socket and save it to PCAP files or re-inject that traffic to a local network interface
* Include threat intelligence feeds and analyze your suricata and zeek outputs.
