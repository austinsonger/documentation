===============================

OwlH Software TAP to monitor traffic in AWS and GCLOUD environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /img/softwareTAP.png


OwlH Software TAP (vTAP) will collect full or specific traffic from your instances and forward it to OwlH Master that will run the Network IDS tool to do the analysis.

.. _OwlH Software TAP repository: https://github.com/owlh/owlhmaster

This doc will describe a basic configuration using CentOS instances, Bro and Suricata Network IDS and Wazuh Integration. (other Linux distributions as well as Windows Support is available)

There are a lot of moving pieces, feel free to ask for help support@owlh.net. This doc will try to simplify deployment but for sure it will need some customization as well as may need some architecture understanding.

Main steps:

* Introduction: How does it work?


* Prepare your environment
   * Option: Create an administration network
   * OwlH Master
   * Suricata NIDS
   * BRO NIDS
   * Wazuh Integration
   * Default configuration settings
* Register your instances
   * Define Instances settings
   * Configure your instance
* Enjoy it



Introduction: What does Sotware TAP do and how does it work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Software TAP is for capture traffic in remote instances, transport captured traffic to a central analysis platform, analyze the traffic and alert. It works in any environment, but it is really useful when you need this visibility in a cloud environment. 

Main Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /img/nettap-components.png

There are different components.

* OwlH Master
   * Orchestration
   * Dummy Interface
   * Network IDS
* Target Instances
* Storage and Visualization
* Wazuh Integration


.. note:: For cloud like AWS or Google Cloud should be good idea to deploy our instances with two different network interfaces, so we can use main interface as public service interface and secondary for management propouses, as traffic forward from instances to OwlH system

----

OwlH Master Orchestration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prepare OwlH Master software
----------------------------

::

    # sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhmaster/master/softwareTAP/config.sh > /tmp/configure_OwlHmaster.sh
    # sudo bash /tmp/configure_OwlHmaster.sh
    # rm /tmp/configure_OwlHmaster.sh

OwlH Master ssh Key
-------------------

* Copy your owlh master ssh key to your instances /tmp folder. Be sure it is in the right place.

::

    # scp /home/owlh/.ssh/owlhmaster.pub user@1.1.1.1:/tmp/owlhmaster.pub 

.. note:: change user and 1.1.1.1 as required or please, follow your own deployment process to ensure that the owlh master pub key is in place on each instance.

Create Dummy interface for Network IDS
--------------------------------------

::

    # sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/dummy.sh.centos7 > /tmp/dummy.sh
    # sudo bash /tmp/dummy.sh
    # rm /tmp/dummy.sh 



----

Network IDS support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deploy Suricata as Network IDS
------------------------------

.. _Suricata deployment script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/Suricata-install-amazonlinux.sh

`Suricata deployment script`_ will help you to deploy Suricata 4.0.4 from source code in a CentOS 7 box.

.. _Suricata documentation: https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-4.0.4/install.html

If you prefer a different way to deploy suricata, please follow `Suricata documentation`_.

**Run Suricata IDS**


Deploy Bro as Network IDS
-------------------------

.. _Bro deployment script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/Suricata-install-amazonlinux.sh

`Bro deployment script`_ will help you to deploy Bro IDS from source code in a CentOS 7 box.

.. _Bro documentation: https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-4.0.4/install.html

If you prefer a different way to deploy Bro, please follow `Bro documentation`_.

**Run Bro IDS**


OwlH Master Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**OwlH Master Configuration for Software TAP**

We call flock Controller the main process that will drive Software TAP functionality. This is the default configuration file that you will find in your /etc/owlh/ folder. 


::

   {
    "pidfile" : "/tmp/flock.pid",
    "logfile" : "/var/log/owlh/flock.log",
    "inventory" : "/etc/owlh/inventory.conf",
    "owlh_user" : "owlh",
    "owlh_user_key" : "/home/owlh/.ssh/owlhmaster",
    "max_cpu" : "25",
    "max_mem" : "25",
    "max_storage" : "80",
    "capture_time" : "60",
    "default_interface" : "ens33",
    "filter_path" : "/etc/owlh/filter.bpf",
    "local_pcap_path" : "/usr/share/owlh/in_queue/",
    "pcap_path" : "/usr/share/owlh/pcap/",
    "owlh_interface" : "owlh",
    "suricata_on" : "True",
    "bro_on" : "True"
   }

**BPF filter**

You can specify what traffic to be captured if you don't want to capture everything. Main and default configuration will provide filter to not collect management traffic from OwlH master to your agents.

Remember this filter must be deployed into each one agent. be sure it is on each one of your servers.

Your bpf filter should be at least something like this

::

   not host 1.1.1.1 and not port 22

Where 1.1.1.1 must be replaced with your OwlH master ip that will connect to your server.

----


Target Instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will need some tools and a user in each one of your servers in order to coordinate the traffic capture functionality

* Create and configure owl user in your servers

.. _this script:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/owlh-setup.sh.centos7

The owlh user will be use by OwlH Master Orchestrator to run traffic capture and collect pcap files. to create user and configure it please follow `this script`_:

::

    #!/bin/bash
    # Created 28.02.18
    # v0.1 24.05.18 master@owlh.net

    # tested in amazon Linux instance
    # tested GCLOUD - centos7 - CIS version

    # NOTE -- run this script in a server using
    # sudo bash owluser-setup.sh


    sudo adduser owlh
    echo "create owlh user ssh folder"
    sudo -u owlh mkdir /home/owlh/.ssh
    echo "setting ssh folder permissions"
    sudo -u owlh chmod 700 /home/owlh/.ssh
    echo "create authorized keys file"
    sudo -u owlh touch /home/owlh/.ssh/authorized_keys
    echo "setting authorized keys permissions"
    sudo -u owlh chmod 600 /home/owlh/.ssh/authorized_keys
    echo "include owlmaster key"
    echo "be sure you have your owlh master pub key in /tmp/owlhmaster.pub file"
    sudo cat /tmp/owlhmaster.pub >> /home/owlh/.ssh/authorized_keys
    echo "Allow owlh user to login with ssh"
    sudo sed -i '/^AllowUsers/s/$/ owlh/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    sudo systemctl restart sshd

    echo "install tcpdump"
    if ! sudo yum list installed tcpdump ; then
        sudo yum -y install tcpdump
    fi

    # Allow owlh use tcpdump with sudo without password
    echo "allow user owlh to use tcpdump and chown"
    #sudo sed -i '/^%wheel/a owlh     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump' /etc/sudoers
    sudo echo "owlh     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump, /usr/bin/chown" >> /etc/sudoers.d/owlh

    # Prepare owlh related stuff folder
    echo "prepare owlh stuff folders /etc, /var/log, /usr/share"
    sudo mkdir /etc/owlh
    sudo mkdir /var/log/owlh
    sudo mkdir /usr/share/owlh
    sudo mkdir /usr/share/owlh/pcap

    sudo chown owlh /etc/owlh
    sudo chgrp owlh /etc/owlh
    sudo chown owlh /var/log/owlh
    sudo chgrp owlh /var/log/owlh
    sudo chown -R owlh /usr/share/owlh
    sudo chgrp -R owlh /usr/share/owlh

    #sudo echo "not host 10.164.0.4 and not port 22" > /etc/owlh/filter.bpf


    # clean and end
    echo "should be done. Enjoy your day."

Script also includes tcpdump installation as part of the traffic capture stuff. Please be sure you have tcpdump running before continue. This step is only needed if you don't have tcpdump installed yet.

::

    echo "install tcpdump"
    if ! sudo yum list installed tcpdump ; then
        sudo yum -y install tcpdump
    fi

    # Allow owlh use tcpdump with sudo without password
    echo "allow user owlh to use tcpdump and chown"
    #sudo sed -i '/^%wheel/a owlh     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump' /etc/sudoers
    sudo echo "owlh     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump, /usr/bin/chown" >> /etc/sudoers.d/owlh

**Modify your bpf filter file.**

----

Wazuh system
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Wazuh documentation: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/index.html

Be sure you have at least one Wazuh manager and elastic stack working before to continue. Please follow `Wazuh documentation`_.


Integrate OwlH master with Wazuh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Wazuh agent deploy: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/installing-wazuh-agent/wazuh_agent_rpm.html

Integrate OwlH master with Wazuh is pretty easy. We only need to deploy our Wazuh agent into the OwlH master. Follow `Wazuh agent deploy`_ instructions for RPM packets to deploy the agent.

in summary, you will set up the repository by running the following command:

::

    # cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/wazuh.repo <<\EOF
    [wazuh_repo]
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH
    enabled=1
    name=Wazuh repository
    baseurl=https://packages.wazuh.com/3.x/yum/
    protect=1
    EOF

and now, install wazuh agent

::

    # yum install wazuh-agent

now, lest register agent into your Wazuh Manager. if you are using authd on your manager:

::

    # register agent
    /var/ossec/bin/agent-auth -m 1.1.1.1 -A owlhmaster

A few things here:

::

    1.1.1.1 # is your wazuh manager ip
    -A      # option means that you want to specify a name other than hostname.
            # This command suppose tcp/1515 port used,
            # if not, you should change command to include the right port.

.. _Register agent documentation: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/registering/index.html

Please review, authd documentation or find a different way to register your agent. `Register agent documentation`_

Finally, modify your ossec.conf file to monitor your suricata output

::

    <localfile>
      <log_format>syslog</log_format>
      <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
    </localfile>

And restart your wazuh agent

    ``$ systemctl restart wazuh-agent``







Register your servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to know a little bit about your network. At least, we need to know what are the servers that you want to capture traffic from.

Please, include in your OwlH server inventory file all your servers /etc/owlh/inventory.json. Define them as needed but keep json format.

:: 

    [
        {
            "id" : "1",
            "name" : "agent-1-openrules",
            "ip" : "192.168.1.218",
            "enabled" : "true",
            "active" : "true"
        },
        {
            "id" : "2",
            "name" : "agent-2-217",
            "ip" : "192.168.1.217",
            "enabled" : "true",
            "active" : "true"
        }
    ]
