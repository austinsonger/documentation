OwlH for AWS
============

OwlH will allow you to monitor traffic in your AWS environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /img/nettap.png


OwlH will use a software TAP (vTAP) to collect specific traffic from your instances network interfaces and forward it to an OwlH appliance that will run the Network IDS tool to do the analysis.

.. _OwlH net-tap repository: https://github.com/owlh/owlhostnettap

Scripts are configs are described here in detail. you may find some links to them inline. Also, if you want, you can access our `OwlH net-tap repository`_ to see all them.

Main steps:

* Prepare your environment
   * Wazuh system
   * main components
* Deploy OwlH master as Suricata Network IDS
* Integrate OwlH master with Wazuh
* Configure Ansible in OwlH master
   * Delay between capture
   * File rotation time
   * Define capture BPF filter
* Configure your servers
* Register your servers
* Integrate into elastic stack
* Network IDS alert enrichment
   * GEO ip
   * Custom
   * PCI-DSS

Wazuh system
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Wazuh documentation: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/index.html

Be sure you have at least one Wazuh manager and elastic stack working before to continue. Please follow `Wazuh documentation`_.

Main Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /img/nettap-components.png

Note: For cloud like AWS or Google Cloud should be good idea to deploy our instances with two different network interfaces, so we can use main interface as public service interface and secondary for management propouses, as traffic forward from instances to OwlH system

Deploy OwlH master as Suricata Network IDS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Suricata deployment script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/Suricata-install-amazonlinux.sh

`Suricata deployment script`_ will help you to deploy Suricata 4.0.4 from source code in a Amazon Linux box.

.. _Suricata documentation: https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-4.0.4/install.html

If you prefer a different way to deploy suricata, please follow `Suricata documentation`_.

----

Integrate OwlH master with Wazuh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Wazuh agent deploy: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/installing-wazuh-agent/wazuh_agent_rpm.html

Integrate OwlH master with Wazuh is pretty easy. We only need to deploy our Wazuh agent into the OwlH master. Follow `Wazuh agent deploy`_ instructions for RPM packets to deploy the agent.

in summary, you will set up the repository by running the following command:

::

    # cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/wazuh.repo <<\EOF
    [wazuh_repo]
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH
    enabled=1
    name=Wazuh repository
    baseurl=https://packages.wazuh.com/3.x/yum/
    protect=1
    EOF

and now, install wazuh agent

::

    # yum install wazuh-agent

now, lest register agent into your Wazuh Manager. if you are using authd on your manager:

::

    # register agent
    /var/ossec/bin/agent-auth -m 1.1.1.1 -A owlhmaster

A few things here:

::

    1.1.1.1 # is your wazuh manager ip
    -A      # option means that you want to specify a name other than hostname.
            # This command suppose tcp/1515 port used,
            # if not, you should change command to include the right port.

.. _Register agent documentation: https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/registering/index.html

Please review, authd documentation or find a different way to register your agent. `Register agent documentation`_

Ginally, modify your ossec.conf file to monitor your suricata output

::

    <localfile>
      <log_format>syslog</log_format>
      <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
    </localfile>

And restart your wazuh agent

    ``$ systemctl restart wazuh-agent``

----

Configure Ansible in OwlH master
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please, remember that we are working in an amazon linux system. Check ansible documentation if you want to deploy it in a different system

* Allow EPEL repository configuration

Edit epel.repo and enable epel repository

::

    sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo

    include
    [epel]
    ...
    enabled=1 # by default is set to 0

save and close it.

* Install ansible

   ``$ sudo yum -y install ansible``

* Create Ansible Key that will be used to manage Traffic capture in your servers

::

   # Create ssh keys
   ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -C "owlmaster@owlh.net" -f ~/.ssh/owl -N ""

Check your owl.pub file and remember that you will use it when registering your servers in OwlH master

::

    cat owl.pub # it should looks like this
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDAfHtB6SGRdWXYEkI+TPgRwnOvwHP0rETVW20X+fokSGmPxH32S2JOw7XoSKp6/sdlqT/iBLhewFsKqc1l+Cx6i/U8httZNBLnDcE/Y8Q5RUoZQqyv2mlrrbtUHeY3Cxm6tOP0sS5iEtg4gCpUage1wDDPITsg9OtX1ljoxn+67QJJuZa7q4J41KQZYD1IyH3HSuA8hk6hURdb+hc9GycQZ6wkejRURlll6j9vfO0dMl4KN6U8QA8g4s7/j10MZJlf1UK2a0U1taqYI1zkPEyJnLDQYkI41+AeHoSuElfN7IG2e+EZOWxcTGL/5dRK5+Hb1dx1iK1rBUzHMW7s0b21 owlmaster@owlh.net

* Create a playbook folder

::

    # create palybooks folder
    sudo mkdir /etc/ansible/playbooks


Install traffic capture Ansible playbooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Traffic capture control: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/tcpdump.yaml

* Traffic capture control playbook:

This is `Traffic capture control`_ playbook

::

   # owlmaster
   # Version 0.0
   # Ansible Playbook - run tcpdump on destination
   # use '-Z owl' after -F option with tcpdump command if you need to specify owl user.

   - hosts: srvs
     tasks:
       - name: start tcpdump on servers
         shell: "(sudo tcpdump -i {{ ansible_default_ipv4.interface }} -G 3 -w {{ pcaps_path }}$(hostname)-%y%m%d%H%M%S.pcap -F myfilter &)"
         async: 10
         poll: 0
         become: true
         become_user: owl
         become_method: su

* Captured traffic management: Move captured traffic to OwlH, clean remote server traffic files.

.. _Traffic management: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/pcapmanage.yaml

.. _Transport and clean: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/getanddelete.yaml

Remote `Traffic management`_

::

   # owlmaster
   # Version 0.0
   # Ansible Playbook - get pcap files from servers

   - hosts: srvs

    tasks:
       - name: get pcap files from servers folder, older than age (period) in seconds
         find:
           paths: "{{ pcaps_path }}"
           age: "{{ period }}"
         register: pcap_files

       - include_tasks: getanddelete.yaml pcap_file={{ item.path }}
         with_items:
           - "{{ pcap_files.files }}"

`Transport and clean`_ remote traffic

::

   # owlmaster
   # Version 0.0
   # Ansible tasks file - get file and delete file

   ---

   - name: get remote PCAP file
     fetch:
       src: "{{ pcap_file }}"
       dest: "{{ localpcaps_path }}"
       flat: yes

   - name: delete remote PCAP file
     file:
       path: "{{ pcap_file }}"
       state: absent



* Analyze captured traffic with Suricata

::

   # owlmaster
   # Version 0.0
   # Ansible Playbook - get PCAP files ready to be analyzed

   - hosts: localhost

     tasks:
       - name: get PCAP files ready to be analyzed
         find:
           paths: "{{ pcaps_path }}"
         register: pcap_files

       - include_tasks: managesuricata.yaml pcap_file={{ item.path }}
         with_items:
           - "{{ pcap_files.files }}"

* Analyze and clean traffic

NOTE: Please be sure your suricata path is the right one. The one included here is a compiled from 4.0.4 source in a amazon linux instance. It may vary

::

   Suricata binary path: /usr/local/suricata-4.0.4/bin/suricata

   Suricata config path: /usr/local/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

Please, configure your Suricata path as needed.

::

   # owlmaster
   # Version 0.0
   # Ansible tasks file - use suricata to analyze and clean PCAP files

   ---

   - name: read pcap with suricata
     command: sudo {{ suricata_binary }} -c {{ suricata_config }} -r {{ pcap_file }} -k none
     become: true
     become_user: owl
     become_method: su

   - name: mv file to managed queue
     command: mv {{ pcap_file }} {{ managed_pcap }}





* configure your main Variables.

create a file /etc/ansible/group_vars/srvs.yaml and include following lines

Be sure you define the right path for your ansible_ssh_private_key_file. this is the one you have done few lines over this.

.. _Global Ansible Vars: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/srvrs.yaml

Copy the `Global Ansible Vars`_ file to the /etc/ansible/group_vars/srvs.yaml file

**Please, be sure you have right values for each variable.**

::

   ---
   ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /home/ec2-user/.ssh/owl
   ansible_ssh_user: owl

   period: 60
   filterpath: /var/owlh/etc/bpf.filter
   pcaps_path: /var/owlh/traffic/
   managed_pcap: /var/owlh/managed_traffic/
   localpcaps_path: /var/owlh/traffic/

   suricata_binary: /usr/local/suricata-4.0.4/bin/suricata
   suricata_config: /usr/local/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

**NOTE: PCAP behaviour.**

you can choose to store analyzed PCAP files or remove them after analysis is done.

**managed_pcap** means the folder in which one you want to store analyzed PCAP files. This can be useful as forensic storage, so you may want to use an S3 bucket to save them.

If you choose a folder, make sure the folder is present and has the right permissions.



**BPF filter**

You can specify what traffic to be captured if you don't want to capture everything. Main and default configuration will provide filter to not collect management traffic from OwlH master to your agents.

Remember this filter must be deployed into each one agent. be sure it is on each one of your servers.

Your bpf filter should be at least something like this

::

   not host 1.1.1.1 and not port 22

Where 1.1.1.1 must be replaced with your OwlH master ip that will connect to your server.




Configure your servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will need some tools and a user in each one of your servers in order to coordinate the traffic capture functionality

* Create and configure owl user in your servers

.. _this script:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlh/owlhostnettap/master/owluser-setup.sh

The owl user will be use by Ansible to run traffic capture and collect pcap files. to create user and configure it please follow `this script`_:

::

   #!/bin/bash
   # 28.02.18 tested in amazon Linux instance - @owlmaster

   # NOTE -- run this script in a server using
   # sudo bash owluser-setup.sh

   sudo adduser owl
   echo "create owl user ssh folder"
   sudo -u owl mkdir /home/owl/.ssh
   echo "setting ssh folder permissions"
   sudo -u owl chmod 700 /home/owl/.ssh
   echo "create authorized keys file"
   sudo -u owl touch /home/owl/.ssh/authorized_keys
   echo "setting authorized keys permissions"
   sudo -u owl chmod 600 /home/owl/.ssh/authorized_keys
   echo "include owlmaster key - this is your owl.pub created on your OwlH master"
   sudo -u owl echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDUcJhz9gpE2a1gra67eF/0jjsTBtNHRMawZGLDjQM5mXkmcfy4BTrykvuby0eEEO9hhSRMA5so9cAsmAkQKpW0dxRx0Y5c8LKwrtkzmOHrltQrFTeLmaJaojXDIjVch6XNTwOSnOO9b9O5KKjsJe86I55YP+4sf3ux7azEYVEUWzoN5aqELe+Z4+/A93F142QlJLuCra3Jp5GgeZoBBU7H2bKnSOXOmEQHUjiPETDUDTb1xyb3lVdYALAW3P424KvfmoTK+i3S8hy9vMHcgHQUkyH8ijfKbHZ0V0PTC5WEqVp6bGSGmd2qzyUbapeCnzrtWjiGEhFIL+jZoIg3xXH/ owlmaster@owlh.net" >> /home/owl/.ssh/authorized_keys

   # JUST IN CASE -
   # sudo -u owl sudo tcpdump -i eth0

   # Prepare owlh related stuff folder
   echo "prepare owlh stuff folder /var/owlh"
   sudo mkdir /var/owlh
   sudo chown owl /var/owlh
   sudo -u owl mkdir /var/owlh/traffic
   sudo -u owl mkdir /var/owlh/etc
   sudo -u owl mkdir /var/owlh/bin

   echo "install tcpdump"
   sudo yum -y install tcpdump

   # Allow owl use tcpdump with sudo without password
   echo "allow user owl to use tcpdump"
   sudo sed -i '/^root/a owl     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump' /etc/sudoers


   # clean and end
   echo "should be done. Enjoy your day."

Script also includes tcpdump installation as part of the traffic capture stuff. Please be sure you have tcpdump running before continue. This step is only needed if you don't have tcpdump installed yet.

::

   echo "install tcpdump"
   sudo yum -y install tcpdump

   # Allow owl use tcpdump with sudo without password
   echo "allow user owl to use tcpdump"
   sudo sed -i '/^root/a owl     ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump' /etc/sudoers

**Copy bpf filter file.**



Register your servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to know a little bit about your network. At least, we need to know what are the servers that you want to capture traffic from.

Please, include in your OwlH server inventory file all your servers /etc/ansible/hosts. Define them as needed but keep srvs group name.

::

   [srvs]
   1.1.1.1
   2.2.2.2
   3.3.3.3
